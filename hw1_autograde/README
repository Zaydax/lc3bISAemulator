Steps for autograde:
=====================
1.  Copy your solution file (lc3bsim1.c) in this directory
2.  Type "make"
3.  Type "make grade"

This should give you a score out of 100


How to DEBUG if your score is imperfect:
=========================================
This testing framework contains two test suites:
1. A for testing functionality of single instruction
2. B for testing functionality of multiple instructions

If you get an imperfect score and want to only run one of
the two suites, you can do so by typing either
"make gradeA"  or "make gradeB"

Figure out the suite and the test case which failed and 
check your implementation for those instructions.

The test cases for suite A are in ./test/state_data_in

The test cases for suite B are in ./test/data_in
